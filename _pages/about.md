I am passionate about systems programming, cloud computing, and distributed systems. I am also interested in machine learning and security fields. I have completed internships and projects in several of these areas.

I hold an Engineering degree in Computer Science from ENSPY (Yaoundé, Cameroon), and a Master's degree in Cloud and Distributed Systems from Grenoble INP, ENSIMAG (Grenoble, France).

Currently, I am completing my PhD in cloud computing applied to blockchain technology within the <a href="https://www.labri.fr/programmation-reseaux-et-systemes">Progress team</a> at the University of Bordeaux (France). My research focuses on two main topics: enhancing the Byzantine fault tolerance of peer sampling protocols in blockchain systems, and real-time frequency estimation of elements in adversarial memory-constrained environments.

## Recent Achievements

**Best Paper Award** - NCA 2024 (Bertinoro, Italy)
Our paper "AUPE: Collaborative Byzantine fault-tolerant peer-sampling" received the Best Paper Award at the 22nd International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications. This work demonstrates a **60% increase in fault tolerance** compared to existing protocols, maintaining robust operation even when adversaries control up to 40% of system nodes.

## Research Impact

My doctoral research has produced Byzantine fault-tolerant peer sampling protocols that significantly improve the resilience of distributed systems. Key contributions include:

- **Enhanced Security**: Collaborative protocol using SGX-enabled devices for trusted execution environments
- **Superior Resilience**: Near-perfect fault tolerance even with 26% malicious nodes
- **Scalability**: Hash-based techniques for efficient tracking with minimal memory overhead
- **Real-world Applications**: Applicable to blockchain networks, decentralized computing, and large-scale distributed systems

## News

**Seeking Opportunities**: I will complete my PhD in December 2025 and am currently seeking researcher positions in industry or academia, in the fields of systems, networks, or artificial intelligence.

**Recent Service**:
- Session chair at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/wise25-workshop/home">Wise 2025</a> (December 2025)
- Session technician at <a href="https://2025.compas-conference.fr/programme/">Compas 2025</a> (June 2025)
