I am passionate about systems programming, low-level programming, machine learning, embedded systems, parallel computing, cloud computing, and distributed systems. I have completed internships and projects in several of these areas.

I am also interested in security, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and network administration.

I hold an Engineering degree in Computer Science from ENSPY (Yaound√©, Cameroon), and a Master's degree in Cloud and Distributed Systems from Grenoble INP, ENSIMAG (Grenoble, France).

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in cloud computing applied to blockchain technology within the <a href="https://www.labri.fr/programmation-reseaux-et-systemes">Progress team</a> at the University of Bordeaux (France). My research focuses on two main topics: enhancing the Byzantine fault tolerance of peer sampling protocols in blockchain systems, and real-time frequency estimation of elements in memory-constrained environments.

I will complete my PhD in October 2025 and am currently seeking a postdoctoral position or an R&D role in industry in the fields of systems, networks, or artificial intelligence.

Thank you for your recommendations.
